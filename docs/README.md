# Planning Docs

This folder contains the living project plan. The intent is to keep these
documents small, direct, and easy to update as decisions are made.

The Next.js app lives in `web/`.

## How to use

- Start with `00-project-overview.md` to set goals and constraints.
- Fill `05-spec-checklist.md` to remove ambiguity.
- Capture requirements in `10-requirements.md`.
- Review repo structure in `15-repo-structure.md`.
- Design the UX and UI structure in `20-frontend-plan.md`.
- Review AI agent responsibilities in `25-ai-agents.md`.
- Define backend needs in `30-backend-plan.md`.
- Track delivery milestones and testing in `40-milestones.md`.

## Conventions

- Use short bullets and clear ownership.
- Add decisions and rationale when we choose a path.
- Keep open questions visible until resolved.
