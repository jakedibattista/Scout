# Scout

This repo starts with planning docs for a new project. The docs are intended
to be living artifacts we refine as we build.

## App location

The Next.js app lives in `web/`.

## Docs Index

- `docs/README.md` - index and how to use the docs
- `docs/00-project-overview.md` - high-level vision, scope, success metrics
- `docs/05-spec-checklist.md` - spec checklist to remove ambiguity
- `docs/10-requirements.md` - functional + non-functional requirements
- `docs/20-frontend-plan.md` - UI/UX, pages, components, states
- `docs/30-backend-plan.md` - architecture, data, APIs, infra
- `docs/40-milestones.md` - delivery phases and test plan

## How we work

We will iterate from high-level to frontend to backend, then implement in
small, deliberate tasks with updates to these docs.
